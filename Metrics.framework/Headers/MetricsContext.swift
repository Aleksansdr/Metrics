 Metrics iOS SDK.
 
 Use the Metrics SDK to track and report events occured in your application.
 
 Developers using the Metrics SDK with their app are required to register for
 a credential, and to specify the credential (apiKey) in their application.
 Failure to do so results in blocked access to certain features and degradation
 in the quality of other services.
 
 To obtain these credentials, visit the developer portal at https://api.approver.io/dev
 and register for a license.
 
 - Note: Credentials are unique to your application's bundle identifier.
 Do not reuse credentials across multiple applications.
 
 Adding Credentials
 
 Ensure that you have provided the apiKey before using the Metrics SDK.
 For example, set them in your app delegate:
 
 ```
 func application(_ application: UIApplication,
 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    try? Metrics.shared.initialize(apiKey: "{YOUR_API_KEY}")
 }
 ```
